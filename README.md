# 📊 Customer Churn Analytics & Prediction Platform

An end-to-end **industry-level data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning project** focused on predicting customer churn and explaining *why* customers leave. The project simulates a real-world business use case used by telecom, banking, SaaS, and subscription-based companies.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn directly impacts revenue. This project builds a complete churn prediction pipeline that:

* Analyzes customer behavior
* Predicts churn probability using ML & DL models
* Explains model decisions using SHAP
* Visualizes insights via BI dashboards
* Deploys a real-time prediction web app

---

## 🧠 Business Problem

> **Objective:** Identify customers likely to churn so proactive retention strategies can be applied.

> **Why it matters:** Retaining customers is significantly cheaper than acquiring new ones.

**Primary Metric:** ROC-AUC (to minimize missed churners)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming:** Python
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Explainability:** SHAP
* **BI Tools:** Power BI / Tableau
* **Deployment:** Streamlit
